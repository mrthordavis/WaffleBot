# WaffleBot
This is the source code of my Discord.py bot.

To get WaffleBot up and running you have to install Python. I recommend any version under 3.7 and over 3.5.
Next thing you have to do is install Discord.py Rewrite. 
1.Open CMD(command prompt) as an administrator.
2. Install Discord.py Rewrite by pasting in this install command: pip install -U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/rewrite.zip
3. Wait for it to install, if a permission error occurs then that means you didn't open CMD(command prompt) as an administrator.
4. You are all set to host WaffleBot.
